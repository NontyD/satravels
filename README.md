## Color scheme

![SA Flag](/assets/images/readme/)

My website's color scheme is inspired by the vibrant and diverse colors of the South African flag. The use of these colors not only enhances the visual appeal of my site but also reflects the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of South Africa. To ensure readability and accessibility, I have adjusted the darker shades to provide better contrast.

To enhance accessibility and ensure that all users, including those with visual impairments, can comfortably interact with our website, I have adjusted the darker shades of the color palette. This approach ensures that there is sufficient contrast between text and background elements, making the content easy to read and navigate.
