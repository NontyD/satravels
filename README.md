## Design
## Color scheme

![SA Flag](/assets/images/readme/sa-flag.png)

My website's color scheme is inspired by the vibrant and diverse colors of the South African flag. The use of these colors not only enhances the visual appeal of my site but also reflects the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of South Africa. 

To enhance accessibility and ensure that all users, including those with visual impairments, can comfortably interact with our website, I have adjusted the darker shades of the color palette. This approach ensures that there is sufficient contrast between text and background elements, making the content easy to read and navigate.

   ### Typography
The typography on the website is thoughtfully designed to create a user-friendly experience while reinforcing the brand's identity and making the content easy to read and engaging. 

##### Font Choices

The primary font used across the website is 'Poppins' from Google fonts. It is modern, clean, and easy to read. This choice reflects the site's professional and approachable tone, making it accessible to a broad audience.

##### Readability

The font sizes are appropriately chosen for different elements, with larger sizes for headings and a comfortable size for body text. This ensures that users can easily read the content without straining their eyes, whether they are on a desktop or mobile device.
   
   ### Imagery

   The SA website uses imagery effectively to enhance the user experience and convey the beauty and diversity of South Africa. Here are some key points about the imagery on the site:

##### High-Quality Visuals

* The website features high-resolution images that capture the stunning landscapes, vibrant cities, and unique wildlife of South Africa. * These visuals are integral to engaging users and inspiring them to explore the country.
* The hero image on the homepage particularly striking, setting the tone for the overall aesthetic of the site and creating a strong visual impact upon entry. It is an image of the City of Cape Town.
  
##### Relevant and Thematic Imagery

* Each image is carefully selected to match the theme of the page or section it represents. For example, the Calendar page features a typical weather for each month, while the Destinations features scenic photos of beaches, mountains, and cultural landmarks.
* This thematic consistency helps reinforce the content and provides users with a visually cohesive experience as they navigate the site.

##### Enhancing User Engagement

* The imagery is used not just decoratively but functionally, helping to break up text and make the content more engaging. This balance between text and visuals keeps users interested and encourages them to spend more time exploring the site.
* Interactive elements, like clickable images are also visually enhanced, making it easy for users to interact with the site’s features.

  ### Wireframes

Wireframes for desktop were created using balsamiq. The wireframes were the initial idea which has since changed as I got some inspirations.

  ### Accessibility

The website demonstrates a strong commitment to accessibility, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the content effectively. Here’s an overview of the accessibility features integrated into the site:

* Proper Use of HTML Tags: The website utilizes semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>, which provide clear structure and meaning to the content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the page's layout and navigate it more easily.
* ARIA Landmarks: Where necessary, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and landmarks are used to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements and to provide additional context to assistive technologies.
* Tab Navigation: The site is fully navigable using the keyboard, allowing users to tab through links, form fields, and buttons without requiring a mouse. This is crucial for users with mobility impairments or those who rely on keyboard shortcuts.
* Focus Indicators: Visible focus indicators highlight which element is currently selected, ensuring that keyboard users can easily track their position on the page and interact with the site efficiently.
* Alt Text for Images: All images on the website include descriptive alt text, providing context for users who are visually impaired and rely on screen readers. This ensures that essential visual content is accessible to everyone, even if they cannot see the images.
* Functional Graphics: Icons and images that serve a functional purpose (e.g., buttons, logos) are also labeled with appropriate alt text, ensuring they are accessible and understandable.
* High Contrast Design: The website features a color scheme that offers sufficient contrast between text and background colors, making it easier for users with visual impairments to read the content. This also benefits users viewing the site in various lighting conditions or on different devices.
* Avoidance of Color-Dependent Information: Information is not solely conveyed through color, ensuring that users with color blindness or other visual impairments can still access all content. For example, important links and buttons are not just distinguished by color but also by underline or bold text.
* Adaptive Layout: The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices. This is crucial for accessibility, as it ensures that content is readable and navigable on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers alike.
* Flexible Text and Media: Text and images scale appropriately depending on the device being used, preventing issues such as tiny text on small screens or overly large images on desktops.
* Labels and Instructions: All form fields on the contact page are clearly labeled, with instructions provided where necessary. This helps users understand what information is required and reduces the likelihood of errors.
* Error Prevention and Feedback: The forms are designed to prevent errors by requiring certain fields and validating inputs (e.g., email addresses). When an error occurs, clear feedback is provided, allowing users to correct their submissions easily.
* Alt Text for Visual Content: Multimedia content, like images, includes descriptive alt text, ensuring that users with visual impairments can still access the information conveyed by these elements.
* Text-Based Content: The website primarily relies on text-based content, which is naturally more accessible, but when multimedia is used, it is done so in a way that supports accessibility guidelines.
